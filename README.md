The light sensor, also known as the light dependent resistor (LDR). Typically, the resistance of the light sensor will decrease when the ambient light intensity increases.

There is another production - Grove - Light Sensor (P), which is identical except the Grove connecter is moved to the back so that you can easily use it as a neat and wire-free human interface device.
